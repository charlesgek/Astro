I wanted to test a new kind of experiment and lab that could be available for everyone to reproduce and train their skillset or simply a production cluster, all for free.

I will split the articles in different parts :

1. The choice of the Cloud Provider - Oracle Cloud, Always Free Plan (Pros and Cons)
2. The choice of the OS and Kubernetes distribution - Kairos OS Alpine Version with k0s (For MAXIMUM performances with limited ressources)
3. Install a Highly-Available cluster with Kairos OS and k0s on Oracle Cloud using Terraform / OpenTofu
4. Secure Kairos OS according to the NIST's recommendations in the Application Container Security Guide
5. Installing Flux CD to integrate within your CI/CD Pipeline
6. Tools to make your life easier - Lens, K0smotron, k0rdent, k9s and others
7. Build Custom Images for your Kubernetes Cluster
8. Automations for your Kubernetes Cluster

Once all the articles will be finished the whole project details and results will be published in the Projects section.
